Benchmark Privacy NLP tools and technique to improve privacy NLU

The code in this repository is an amalgamation for various code used for my final project
Improving Privacy Language Domain NLU benchmarks for LLMs.  As such it won't compile or run by itself.

This code was used in conjunction with the https://github.com/JFChi/PLUE project to benchmark various 
Privacy Large Langauge Models.  

One of the specific models tested was PrivBERT from the PrivaSeer Project https://privaseer.ist.psu.edu/.

The model can be accessed here: https://huggingface.co/mukund/privbert

The PLUE models that were pre-trained by me for this project can be accessed at Hugging face:
PP-BERT - https://huggingface.co/arvyz/plue-ppbert
PP-RoBERTa - https://huggingface.co/arvyz/plue-pproberta

For this project, I also use LLAMA2 from Meta.
